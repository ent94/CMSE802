    "Step one is to plan what you want your presentation will include.  Most people use slide shows (PowerPoint, Google slides, etc.) to plan what they are going to say and the order they will say it in.  This is a good first step. Although your final video does not need to use slides I highly recommend doing some sort of \"[storyboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)\" for your video to know what parts you want to include and what you don't want to include. \n",
    "\n",

    "- [Zoom](http://zoom.msu.edu): Although primarily intended for live communication,  the Zoom program we use in class is really good at recording video and what you are doing on your desktop.  \n",
    "- [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-snagit.html) Another screen capture program available to Students (or with a free trial). Snagit, is a simple to use video capture program developed by TechSmith (A local company with lots of MSU alumni). A free version of Snagit is available temporarily as long as it is only used for Classwork. [Please see this D2L link for more information and the temporary user agreement](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/1147614/Home).\n",
    "- [Camtasia]() Another really good capture and editing program by TechSmith. This is their elite editing program with a ton of features.  You may need to give yourself some time to learn how to use the program. A free version of Camtasia is available temporarily as long as it is only used for Classwork. [Please see this D2L link for more information and the temporary user agreement](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/1147614/Home).\n",
    "- [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) an Open Source video editor.  \n",
    "- [FFmpeg](http) Open Source command line video conversion tool. Great for taking a folder of images and combining them into an animated video.  \n",
    "- [YouTube](https://YouTube.com/) - You all know this one.  On-line video posting tool.\n",
    "- [MediaSpace](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/) Slightly more secure place to post on-line video. Post here if you want to limit video watching to just your instructors and fellow students.   \n",
