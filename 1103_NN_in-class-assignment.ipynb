So, we have a big array of weights $W$ (for all the synapses and all the layers), several biases $b$ and training data $\\big\\{(x_l , y_l) :  l=1,\\ldots, L \\big\\}$. For each choice of weights and biases,  forward propagation produces an estimate $\\hat{y}(x_l)$ of $y_l$ for each training data point $x_l$. (This is what we did in the pre-class assignment)."
