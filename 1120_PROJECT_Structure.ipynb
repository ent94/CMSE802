We have been doing pieces of this all semester but here we will add a few finishing touches to make the project complete.

    "Note, try to make your ```environment.yml``` file the minimum packages you will need to run your project.  **_Do not_** create an ```environment.yml``` file on your base anaconda environment as this will just install a lot of stuff that is not needed. A good way to figure out your base install is to create a new environment and add packages until your code works. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda create --prefix ./envs pip jupyter pytest pylint pdoc3\n",
    "    conda activate ./envs\n",

    "    conda install numpy\n",
    "    conda install matplotlib\n",
    "    conda install scipy\n",
    "    conda install jupyter\n",
